# Bank_Loan_Eligibility
In this repository, I have train the machine in such a way that it will give us the eligibility that if a bank should loan a person or not based on their details. The main objective of this model is to help banks identify that who can act as a risky customer if loan is granted to them. I have even created a portal by deploying the model so that the user can directly get the result without dealing with the codes. The portal is being made with the help of flask and I have used basic HTML functions and codes for it.
