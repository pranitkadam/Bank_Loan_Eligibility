# Bank_Loan_Eligibility
This is a bank dataset containing information of loan applicants. In this repository, I have trained the machine in such a way that it will give us the eligibility that if a bank should loan a person or not, based on their details. I have used a classification tenchinque calles SVM for this as this is a classification problem. The main objective of this model is to help banks identify that who can act as a risky customer if loan is granted to them. I have even created a portal by deploying the model so that the user can directly get the result without dealing with the codes. The portal is being made with the help of flask and I have used basic HTML functions and codes for it.
